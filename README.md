# Mission to Mars

## Overview

We have been asked to gather data from the web regarding Mars news and weather. We visited the [Mars NASA news site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and the [Mars Temperature Data site](https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html) to gather the appropriate information. 

## Results
